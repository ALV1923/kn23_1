# Github Collaboration Demo

This is a smell demo for my students on how to use Git and Github to collaborate on software projects together.

# How to Collaborate

1. Clone Repo 'git clone https://github.com/ALV1923/kn23_1.git
2. Create Feature-Branch with 'git branch <nameofbranch> && git checkout <nameofbranch>'
3. Make changes...
4. Add changes to staging and commit 'git add. && git commit -m "message"'
5. Push branch 'git push -u origin <nameofbranch>'
